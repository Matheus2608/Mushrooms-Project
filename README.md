# Mushrooms, poisonous or not
This repository is my solution to a project of Introduction to Algorithms course of UNB.

ðŸš€ How to execute:
- Clone the repository using git clone
- Unzip the zip file
- Install the dependencies (os)
- Run python check.py to check if all tests are correct.

Observation: Let me know if you any of my tests are incorrect!

ðŸ”Ž Understanding:
- First, the main ideia of this project is based on K-nearest neighbors algorithm, so if you' re not familiar with it, go check it out [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)

- In [mushrooms_features.txt](/mushrooms_features.txt) is detailed the characteristics of the mushrooms in a dictionary.
- In [introduction.txt](/introduction.txt) is saying how the script works
